# LCFI
# LCFI: Label Correlation and Feature Interaction Framework  This project implements the **LCFI** framework for Imbalanced Label Distribution Learning (ILDL). It models label correlations and feature-label interactions, improving learning stability and generalization, especially with imbalanced label distributions. Built with PyTorch.
